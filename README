This is a fork of the original APG by Adel I. Mirzazhanov.
Adel's original site seems to have disappeared without a trace.
The functionality of this software is exceptional, and IMO without equal.
My intent is to keep this fork maintained and available to all.
Below is the unaltered original README.
Please note that none of this work is my own.

APG v2.2.0 was tested and found working on:

   i386 FreeBSD 5.0-RELEASE
   Intel Solaris 8 gcc-2.95.2
   QNX PRP 6.0
   RedHat Linux 7.2
   Mandrake Linux 9.1
   Win 2000 Pro

NOTE:
This release (APG v2.2.0) is NOT compatible with TkAPG (Tcl/Tk frontend for APG)

Any compatibility reports are welcome 

  * For installation instructions see INSTALL
  * For usage instructions see manpages
  * For tips see doc/APG_TIPS
  * For copying information see COPYING
